# TP2: Introduction to NestJS

NestJS documentation website: https://docs.nestjs.com

## üìù Goal

The goal of this TP is to create a simple Rest API exposing the Bookshelf implemented in TP1.
The API will have the following routes:

## üï∏ Routes

Get all the books stored in the Bookshelf:
- Method: GET
- Route: /books

--

Create a book:
- Method: POST
- Route: /books
- Body:
  ```json
  {
      "title": "A_TITLE",
      "author": "A_NAME",
      "date": "A_DATE"
  }
  ```
--

Get a book with its isbn:
- Method: GET
- Route: /books/[ISBN_OF_THE_BOOK]

--

Get all books of a given author
- Method: GET
- Route: /books?author=[NAME_OF_THE_AUTHOR]

--

Delete a book with its isbn:
- Method: DELETE
- Route: /books/[ISBN_OF_THE_BOOK]

 
---

To guide you and help you find out if everything is ‚úÖ:
- a E2E (end-to-end) test suite is available in `./app.e2e-spec.ts`. These tests can be run using Jest in command line or inside your IDE.
- a Postman collection is available in this project directory (BookShelf.postman_collection.json). Import it in Postman to easily execute some requests.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Open a terminal, go to the directory of this TP and run the following commands:

```sh
# This will install all needed dependencies
npm install

# This will run the tests once
npm run test

OR

# This will run the tests everytime a change is made in the source code
npm run test:watch

# This will build the source and put the transpiled code in `/dist` directory
npm run build

# This will start the API 
npm run start:dev
```

That's it! You can code!

## üõ∞ Extra

- Add an endpoint to search a book based on a part of the title/the author:
  - Method: POST
  - Route: /books/search
  - Body:
   ```javascript
   {
     "term": "A_TITLE"
   }
   ```

- Add some validation to ensure that data are valid when creating a **Book**

## üîë Solution

An implementation of the TP is available on `solution` branch. To switch to the solution just do:

```
# Commit or revert your local changes
# git add . && git commit -m "YOUR_MSG" 

# Update your repository
git pull

# Switch to `solution` branch
git checkout solution
```
